These are notes transcribed and added annotations.
The book is arranged with each chapter explaining a tip.
The *main goal* of thiese notes are to take a few of these points and see
where I can make a story out of them.

- Embrace change
  - Embracing change has an opportunity cost. Do nothing or do something. 
    This duality bring an interesting question about identity.
    What happens if you do one thing over another?
    What happens in that story line versus yours?

    > One day I sat down and wrote two versions of my obituary. 
    > The first was the one that I wanted to have. 
    > I thought of the obituaries that I enjoyed reading, 
    > the people that I admired. 
    > They were the adventurers and risk-takers, 
    > the people who seemed to have lived many lifetimes in one, 
    > the people who had tried lots of things, some of them successes, 
    > some of them spectacular failures, but at least they’d had the guts to try. 
    > They didn’t give a damn what anybody thought of them; 
    > their own opinion of themselves was all that mattered. 
    > They lived life with a greediness for new experiences, and gumption, 
    > and a gung-ho attitude that defied the attempts of naysayers 
    > and nigglers to pigeonhole them or put them down. 
    > These people really knew how to live.
    >
    > The second version was the obituary that I was heading for 
    > – a conventional, ordinary life – pleasant and with its moments of excitement,
    > but always within the safe confines of normality.
    >
    > The difference between the two was startling. 
    > Clearly something was going to have to change.
